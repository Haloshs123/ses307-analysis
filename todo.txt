TODO:
- analysis pipeline: Make script that just does the things want do (imports pandas implimentation.py and then
executes functions in desired order)

Functionality:
- "Noise signal removal" -> smoothing on acceleration function? gaussian probably?
    - detect significant outliers and replace them with nan?
    - smoothing filter probably
- Event detection... differentiate a-axis (or combined magnitude to account for rotation?) and determine periods that are above a threshold
- Deviation...
    - find direction of average acceleration vector (buckets? adjacent n rows?), normalize it to 9.8 m/s^2 (assumption is motion is mostly downwards: deviations in acceleration are due to rotation more than an acceleration)
    - compare individual accelerations to this avg acc, potentially to determine rotations?
- graph/axis formatting for producing report figures.


create plots of the raw data points:
- auto-set boundaries for the plots
